        <h2>English</h2>
        <p>I am so grateful that English is my first language.</p>
        <p>One of my passions is teaching English because I can see how speaking English fluently can provide individuals with many more opportunities in life. I am currently in the process of becoming a Secondary School Teacher and will be teaching English to speakers of other languages in disadvantaged schools.</p>

        <h2>Mandarin</h2>
        <p>When people see my asian ethnicity they typically assume that I speak Chinese, unfortunately that's really not the case!</p>
        <p>Though my parents are able to speak Mandarin, they tried to speak English at home when they moved to Australia. However, when I reached university I could see the immense value of learning Mandarin so I completed a Diploma of Languages in Mandarin alongside my Bachelor degree.</p>

        <h2>Spanish</h2>
        <p>After doing a semester abroad in Barcelona, I fell in love with the Spanish language.</p>
        <p>As the second most spoken langauge in the world I think that it is also another incredible useful language. My dream is to become conversationally fluent and then travel around South America.</p>
