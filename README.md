[Techdegree Project 1 - Personal Profile Page on github pages](https://gracemarsh.github.io/profile/)

This first project allowed me to practice web design skills by customizing a web page to create a personal profile. I modified the code for a basic web page by adding graphics, custom text, and a stylish design. 

This project also introduced me to using GitHub, an important tool used by millions of developers to share code and work collaboratively on programming projects.
